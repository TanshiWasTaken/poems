Why wound a soul whose only aim was to adore?
To lash out at love, to settle a score,
Is to strike a match in a field of dry hay,
Watching the flames consume all in its way.

Why crush a heart, so pure and so kind,
Whose beats were a symphony, with love as the rhyme,
Is to pluck the petals from a rose in full bloom,
Leaving behind a scent of sadness, an empty room.

Why shatter a spirit, so bright and so true,
Whose gaze held the stars and the moon for you,
Is to take a hammer to a piece of delicate glass,
Leaving behind fragments of a beauty that cannot pass.

Why push away someone whose arms were open wide,
Whose love was a balm, a comfort, a guide,
Is to turn a deaf ear to a song so sweet and low,
And to miss the harmony that only love can bestow.

So why hurt someone whose only intention was to love,
Whose heart and soul were yours, sent from above,
Is to waste a treasure, a gift beyond measure,
And to drown in a sea of regret, beyond all pleasure.

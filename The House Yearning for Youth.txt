An old house stands tall, creaky and worn,
Its windows and doors, weathered and torn,
With memories etched in its wooden walls,
It yearns for life, for the laughter that falls.

The floorboards creak as the wind blows by,
A lonely sigh, as it yearns to fly,
Back to a time when it echoed with cheer,
When love filled its rooms, its heart warm and clear.

The chimney whispers its longing for fire,
For the warmth and the smoke, its desire,
To cook up a meal and heat up a bed,
To bring life back to its tired old head.

The roof shivers, it longs for the rain,
To cleanse its soul and ease its pain,
For it knows it will never be the same,
As it was when it was young and its life was sane.

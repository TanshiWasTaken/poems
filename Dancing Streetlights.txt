The fog creeps in, a shroud of mist
A veil that covers, a tryst
With mystery, so thick and dense
It wraps the world in silent tense.

The streetlights dance, a ghostly glow
In this world of soft, surreal flow
The sounds of life, so far away
As if we've stumbled on a dreamy play.

And in this dream, we move slow
Lost in thought, our minds aglow
Admiring nature's artful trick
A masterpiece of white and slick.

The fog, a symbol of the unknown
A gift of mystery, all its own
It holds us captive with its grace
And in its embrace, we find a peaceful place.

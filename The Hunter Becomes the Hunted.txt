Once the hunter, now the hunted, preyed on all with sights unslung,
Society a seething scene, where power is a crooked king,
Greed and might, a deadly pair, that plunge the masses in despair,
A vicious cycle, where the strong, hold the title, where right is wrong.

The hunter, armed with wealth and fame, on others' backs, they built their name,
A predator with voracious goals, devouring all that's good and whole,
The hunted, mere vessels of their will, slaves to power, so prone to spill,
Their fate inescapable, bound to break, at the hands of the hunter's make.

The rich, a lecherous breed, that fatten on the poor's misdeed,
Their wealth, a web, that binds in knots, the lives of those they call their props,
The poor, a horde, that huddle close, in fear of the hunter's lethal blows,
A vicious dance, between two classes, in which the hunter always passes.

The strong, a shadow that stalks, the weak, with all their power and chalk,
The hunted, a spectrum of strife, a life of pain and endless night,
In a society, so steeped in sin, the hunter becomes the hunted's kin,
A chain reaction, that repeats, where the hunter becomes the hunted's meat.

The hunted, a horde, that yearns for change, a brighter future, out of the hunter's range,
Their voices, echoes in the wind, a rallying call, a clarion din,
But the hunter, with their might and spite, squelches the voice of what is right,
A society, that's lost its soul, where the hunter becomes the hunted's toll.

In conclusion, society's a game, where the hunter becomes the hunted's shame,
A vicious cycle, that repeats, where power corrupts and right retreats,
A call to action, a beacon bright, to break this cycle, and bring some light,
To the masses, who are trapped in pain, and make the hunter, hunted again.

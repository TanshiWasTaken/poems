Beneath the bright stage lights,
Ballerinas dance with all their might.
Their bodies bend, their feet take flight,
In a graceful, flowing, effortless sight.

Like leaves in the wind, they swirl and spin,
In a beautiful ballet, from within.
Their poise, their posture, oh so refined,
A picture of elegance, truly divine.

The art of ballet is a symphony,
Of music, movement, and majesty.
A dance of discipline and dexterity,
A display of pure artistry.

Like petals on a rose, their arms unfurl,
In a dance that touches the very soul.
Their steps, so light, like feathers in the air,
A sight to behold, beyond compare.

The ballerinas, they are like stars,
Shining bright, with no visible scars.
Their beauty, their grace, a wondrous sight,
A feast for the eyes, a delight.

In every pirouette and every leap,
A story is told, a tale to keep.
Of love and loss, of joy and strife,
A dance that takes us beyond life.

The gun blast echoes like a cymbal crash,
A burst of pain that comes in a flash.
Like a balloon that's popped with a pricked pin,
Life deflates with a metallic din.

The bullet pierces through the tender flesh,
A searing wound that leaves one fresh.
Like a red-hot poker thrust up the nose,
The pain consumes and forever grows.

It's a cruel twist of fate, like a stab in the back,
A betrayal of trust, a violent attack.
The shock of it all leaves one feeling low,
Like a bird shot down from the sky's glow.

The blood trickles down, like tears from the eyes,
A constant reminder of the wound's size.
The metallic taste, like poison on the tongue,
A bitter reminder of what's begun.

The mind reels, like a ship in a storm,
The world spins, like a top in a swarm.
The body aches, like a limb that's been broken,
The soul crushed, a heart forever awoken.

And as one lay there, gasping for air,
The reality sets in, beyond repair.
The future's uncertain, the past unclear,
Shot through the nostrils, a fate severe.
